			 		<h1> Welcome to my webpage! </h1>

			 		<br/> 
					I'm a PhD candidate in computational and theoretical fluid dynamics and 
					statistical physics. Also, I'm a member of the
					<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/theodorakisgroup/home?pli=1" target="_blank">
						<abbr title="Soft Matter and Fluids Physics"> Droplet Group</abbr></a> at
					<a href="http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/index_en.php" target="_blank">
						<abbr title="Institute of Physics of Polish Academy of Science"> IPPAS</abbr></a>.
					The primary purpose of my doctoral thesis is about the spontaneous droplet's motion
					on substrates whose surface has a logical arrangement of a particular property.
					For example, we can point to <cite> durotaxis </cite> motion which is observable
					on substrates with stiffness gradient on their surface.
					</article>
					<br/>
					<article>
					I also have good knowledge of C/C++ and python programming languages in order to 
					implement mathematical algorithms and discretisation methods to solve and simulate 
					systems of bio-physics and  physics-based. To begin learning to program in C/C++ 
					you should get a rudimentary experience in working with content such as pointers, 
					arrays, classes, objects, data types, and some other advanced contexts to improve 
					the realms of your knowledge; There are many books which have postulated the basics 
					and advanced levels of programming such as <a href="https://www.amazon.pl/C-Primer-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113">C++ Primer</a> and
					<a href="https://www.empik.com/effective-modern-c-meyers-scott,p1101067734,ksiazka-p">Effective Modern C++</a>. The first book can assist
					you in gaining prior knowledge in programming, and the latter enhances your insight. Most of the time, writing code in C/C++ takes 
					too much time and more than our expectation. On the other hand, we would like to share our program with others, at the moment, The importance of 
					having experience in scripting and working with high-level languages like python, V, and Julia is turned out. There are tons of sources for learning high-level
					programming languages, but, you can refer <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 school</a> website, 
					<a href="https://www.amazon.pl/dp/1449355730?tag=hackr0d-21&geniuslink=true">Learning python</a>, 
					<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/getting-started-with-v-programming/9781839213434">Getting Started with V Programming</a>, 
					and <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-julia/9781785883279">Learning Julia</a> books. The above books and websites 
					tighten the rock of your programming knowledgge, while the next step of being a good programmer (Not a coder!) is having a vast view over all simulating methods and algorithms.

					<br/>
					<br/>
					To perform a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, I suggest you writing a program just to learn what MD is!! then you can use <a href="https://www.lammps.org/">LAMMPS</a>,
					<a href="https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io">HOOMD-Blue</a>, or <a href="https://www.gromacs.org/">Gromacs</a> packages which are the bests among all MD simulators. After a successful simulation, we need to
					visualise the results of the simulation in the form of an animation or graphs; the best application nowadays is <a href="https://www.ovito.org/">OVITO</a>, it is not only 
					a visualisation package but also a python interpreter (file reader) for analyzing your system's trajectories. The second rank belongs to 
					<a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>, and <a href="https://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</a>. Although, you able to find a ton of visuallisation apps, but they always have some restrication for reading
					and displaying trajectories files! Generally, people tend to use <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seeborn</a> packages to plot their graphs, but I honestly
					believe the best plotting apps is <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a> for ever!!
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The last but not least, to present your research you should write a letter or make a presentation for people or your colleagues! we don't count supervisor as a
					colleague for sure! anyway, you have to write and what is better than <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">Latex</a>!! you can waste your time with Microsoft Office, while people
					are advancing through <a href="https://opensource.com/">Open source world</a>!
